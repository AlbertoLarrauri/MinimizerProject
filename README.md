## Minimizer project

### How to build

In order to build the project, Cryptominisat 5.8.0 must be installed in your system (other versions may work as well, but I cannot vouch for that). This version can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat/releases/tag/5.8.0), and the instructions to install it can be found [here](https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat). 
After this the project can be built running the following commands from the project folder:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
